# JIMWLK

The code solves JIMWLK evolution equation using Langevin step method

Originally written by BjÃ¶rn Schenke


This version supports the following workflow:
* Read in Wilson line from file input_filename defined in file "input" (set by init_method 10 or 11 in the input file)
* Solve JIMWLK evolution and write output to files output_dir/input_filename_steps_NN, where NN is the number of steps taken

At fixed coupling, steps is related to the Bjorken x via steps =  alphas * log(x0/x)/ (pi*pi*ds), where ds is defined in input file and x0 can be taken to be 0.01 or so
At running coupling, steps=log(x0/x)/(pi*pi*ds)

The input Wilson lines should be generated by the IPGlasma code.

In the input file, if simpleLangevin is set to 1, the JIMWLK is solved using the method from 1212.4825 which does not require adjoint Wilson lines -> faster, and needs less memory

At running coupling, the parameter m that suppresses long distance Coulomb tails is given in GeV in the input file, see 1407.8458 for details
